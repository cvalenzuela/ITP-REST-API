# ITP REST API

The ITP REST API allows real-time access to information about ITP. We originally created it with the intention to notify people from the ITP community when there is free food at the floor, but it has the capability of being expanded to other user-cases. Hardware on the floor updates the database and clients connect to it via SMS or HTTP (you can test the HTTP POST requests using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) ).

## API Reference

The API is live at `165.227.188.111:9888` and at the phone number given in class.

- ### `GET /api/food` or `TEXT 'Food'`

  > Get the current free food status of the floor.

- ### `POST /api/food`

  > Update the status of free food. It requires a valid access token. This method accepts three values must be sent in the body:
  > - status: true or false - Required
  > - token: APIKEY - Required
  > - image: A .jpg, .png or .gif of the current food - Optional

- ### `TEXT 'I want food'`

  > Subscribe to food anouncements. You will receive a SMS notification everytime there is free food on the floor.

- ### `TEXT 'No food for me'`

  > Unsubscribe to food anouncements. You will no longer receive SMS notifications.

- ### `GET /api/forks` or `TEXT 'Forks'`

  > Get the current amount of forks in the kitchen.

- ### `GET /api/floor` or `TEXT 'Floor'`

  > Get the status of the floor. Is it open or not.

- ### `TEXT 'Make me a sandwich' (or something similar)`

  > Make a sandwich.
